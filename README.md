# Ore-Go-Trail
My personal project of recreating Oregon Trail in Go as I learn that language.

## Why
I decided as a personal hobby to learn Go (aka Golang). I figured I needed a project as motivation. I never played Oregon Trail, so I would have no sentimental attachments in case I royally fuck it up.
