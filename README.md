# Ore-Go-Trail
My personal project of recreating Oregon Trail in Go as I learn that language.

## Why
I decided as a personal hobby to learn Go (aka Golang). I figured I needed a project as motivation. I never played Oregon Trail, so I would have no sentimental attachments in case I royally fuck it up.

## BTW
If you look at the code, you will undoubtedly notice some bad Go code. I'm making this as I learn Go, so you will not see any wondrous code. As I learn more and read more, I'll update the code. While you can comment about how shitty my code will be, I'll probably ignore it. You've been warned. If you have polite constructive help, then by all means, put in an issue. I'd like to learn from experienced gophers.
